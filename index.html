                <b>The 2019 Pulwama attack occurred on 14 February 2019, when a convoy
                    of vehicles carrying Indian security personnel on the Jammu–Srinagar
                    National Highway was attacked by a vehicle-borne suicide bomber at
                    Lethapora in the Pulwama district of the erstwhile state of Jammu
                    and Kashmir. The attack killed 40 Indian Central Reserve Police
                    Force (CRPF)[a] personnel as well as the perpetrator—Adil Ahmad
                    Dar—who was a local Kashmiri youth from the Pulwama district.[5][6]
                    The responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Pakistan-based
                    Islamist terrorist[7] group, Jaish-e-Mohammed.[8] India blamed
                    neighbouring Pakistan for the attack, while the latter condemned the
                    attack and denied having any connections to it.[9] The attack dealt
                    a severe blow to India–Pakistan relations, consequently resulting in
                    the 2019 India–Pakistan military standoff. Subsequently, Indian
                    investigations identified 19 accused. By August 2021, the main
                    accused along with six others had been killed, and seven had been
                    arrested.[2] The Indian government ignored at least 11 intelligence
                    inputs from multiple sources, including by the Indian intelligence
                    agency Intelligence Bureau and Jammu and Kashmir Police, before the
                    attack. Satya Pal Malik, who was the governor of the state at the
                    time, later alleged in an interview with Karan Thapar that the Prime
                    Minister Narendra Modi asked him to remain silent on security lapses
                    by his administration.[10][11] In April 2023, the Home Minister of
                    India Amit Shah rejected the allegations and said that the
                    government has nothing to hide. He questioned the credibility of
                    Malik's allegations and asked why he didn't raise these issues when
                    he was the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir. Shah asked why Malik
                    raised these issues after leaving the government</b>

        <h2>The attack:</h2>
        <p>The Attack:
                A convoy of 78 vehicles carrying over 2,500 CRPF personnel was targeted.
                The suicide bomber, Adil Ahmed Dar, rammed his explosive-laden vehicle into a CRPF bus.
                The blast was powerful enough to cause significant damage to multiple vehicles and the
                surrounding area.
                The Pulwama attack was a terrorist attack that occurred on February 14, 2019, in Pulwama district, Jammu and Kashmir, India. A convoy of vehicles carrying Indian security personnel on the Jammu–Srinagar National Highway was attacked by a vehicle-borne suicide bomber, killing 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel and the attacker.   

                The attack was claimed by the Pakistan-based Islamist terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed. The suicide bomber, Adil Ahmad Dar, was a local Kashmiri youth from Pulwama district.   
                
                The attack led to widespread condemnation from the international community and heightened tensions between India and Pakistan.
                
                 India responded with airstrikes targeting Jaish-e-Mohammed camps in Pakistan</p>

            The Perpetrator:
        </h2>
        <p>Adil Ahmed Dar was a young Kashmiri militant who had joined Jaish-e-Mohammed.
                He was reportedly radicalized and trained in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.
                After the explosion in Pulwama, a team from NIA sets out to find out the masterminds behind the catastrophe.

        <h1>CONCLUSION:</h1>
        <p><b>The Pulwama attack was a devastating event that had far-reaching consequences. It significantly escalated
                tensions between India and Pakistan, leading to a military standoff. The attack also highlighted the
                persistent threat of terrorism in the region and the need for stronger counter-terrorism measures. While
                the immediate aftermath saw heightened tensions and retaliatory actions, the long-term implications
                continue to shape the geopolitical landscape of the region. The attack serves as a stark reminder of the
                human cost of terrorism and the urgent need for regional peace and stability.
                The Pulwama attack was a suicide bombing in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, India, on 14 February 2019, when a vehicle carrying 
                explosives rammed into a convoy of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). The attack killed 40 CRPF personnel and injured 
                many more.

                The attack was claimed by the Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). India blamed Pakistan for the attack,
                 while Pakistan denied any involvement.
                
                The attack led to a significant escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan. India launched airstrikes on JeM camps 
                in Pakistan on 26 February 2019, which Pakistan retaliated with airstrikes of its own.
                
                The attack also led to a number of arrests and killings of suspected militants in Kashmir. As of August 2021, 
                14 of the 19 accused in the attack have been killed or arrested.
                
                The Pulwama attack remains a sensitive issue in India and Pakistan. It has had a significant impact on the 
                relationship between the two countries, and it is likely to continue to be a source of tension for years to come.
